# Diagnosis of diabetes - neural network
Neural network made without dedicated libraries such as TensorFlow,  
designed to help diagnose diabetes based on patient data.  
Learning by backpropagation algorithm, explained eg. here   https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-abcc509ca9d0.

## Visualizing data
Seaborn plot displayed at the end of the training.  
We can see that the network lowers the error rate and finds the solution on its own.

## Another sample plot 
Here we see a different learning process  
Because starting weights are random  
But outcome is similiar
